Despite my situation, I had to stifle my laughter. I couldn't help it, the idea behind Noble's Obligation was the same as the idea behind Noblesse Oblige in my past life. It was a reminder that humans were the same in both worlds. Well, maybe the humans in my world had a better naming sense.

Fortunately, Ailsa didn't seem to notice my change in expression. I tried to make the best proud face I could and stared at a guard behind her.

"Noble's Obligation is the idea that nobles should do their best to help the country and commoners."

"So you do know it. I thought you might've not been educated on the concept, but it seems I was mistaken. I tried to reform you by educating you on the true nature of criminals, but you didn't listen. Instead, you disregarded my words. At your current stage, you're one step away from becoming a criminal mastermind. As a royal of Alvaine, it's my duty to reform nobles like you before they damage the country. Prepare yourself." She hit her fists together and approached me.

The first thought that came to my mind was 'She certainly has an imagination doesn't she.' I'm not even sure how to reply to her little speech. If I said I wasn't planning on becoming a criminal, she wouldn't believe me at this point. If I said I did, then she'd probably hit me even harder. In some ways, her fixation on my visits to prison reminded me a bit about Kasa. 

The second thought that came to my mind was 'Maybe I should just take the hit'. Unlike Kasa, who threatened me by summoning a fireball, Ailsa was threatening me with a punch. Sure, a punch would hurt, but if a small amount of pain diffused this situation I was willing to take it. Furthermore, every time I had a conversation that went like this one with Kasa, I ended up saying something that dug me deeper into the pit.  Maybe the best way to deal with people like this is to just not speak. After all, we don't always communicate on the same wavelength.

"Don't worry, I've dealt with goblins before."

I kept my silence as Ailsa slammed her fist into my stomach.

*wheeze*

As I fell to the ground, I tried to let out a scream, but the air was knocked out of my lungs. I tried to gasp for air, but I had trouble breathing. As I began inhaling faster, I started coughing. Panic was setting in. I tried to cover my mouth to keep the air inside my body, but I was shaking too much to keep them together. If this was her holding back, she'd probably obliterate me if she tried. Mistake, this was such a mistake. I couldn't help but wonder why she was so cruel. I thought she'd have a little more mercy because of my circumstances, but I was wrong. She's incredibly cruel. Even now Ailsa didn't try to heal me, she just stared at me. I tried to get up, but I was so dizzy I kept falling to the ground.

After an eternity had passed, Ailsa told the elf to heal me.

To my happiness and despair, the healing magic worked partially. While I felt no pain anymore, I still had trouble breathing and my hands were still shaking.

After watching me for some more time, Ailsa spoke to me.

"Your injuries are healed, stand up."

'No way I'm taking another one of these hits.' I thought to myself. I can't deal with this type of pain. had to get out of this situation right now, even it gave me future trouble. By this point, I was starting to breathe normally and was deciding what lie to use. 

"Stop stalling for time, the guard that came with you is occupied at the moment."

Although my breathing returned to normal, my body was still shaking. I propped myself against a tree and stood up.

"Misunderstanding, you've got a misunderstanding." 

"I've understood your motives well enough. Fear is the only thing that motivates people like you."

"I'm not sure you're thinking, but it's definitely not my motive. I wanted to keep it a secret but you left me no choice."

I looked straight at Ailsa.

"The reason I've been visiting the prison is so I could reform criminals."

Ailsa had an incredulous look on her face.

"Reform?"

"Yes just like you, I also have a goal to reform the empire. The reason for my visits to the prison was to reform the empire as well."

"Do you think I'm a fool?"

"No?"

"Then why did you think I'll believe that flimsy lie."

She started walking towards me. I crouched to the floor and spoke as fast as I could.

"I'm telling the truth I swear, I swear on my life."

Ailsa stood in place and asked in a solemn tone. 

"... You said you'd swear on your life?"

"Yes, I'll swear on my life so please listen to what I have to say and tell me why you don't believe me."

Kasa began her interrogation.

"I don't believe you because my reports said you began visiting the prison when you were 5."

"I visited the prison at that age because I wanted to improve the kingdom."

"Why did you want to improve the kingdom at such a young age?"

"....Because... I thought... that my mother might talk to me again if I did."

"Your mother?"

"Yes, after my aptitude test we haven't spoken much."

"Why haven't you shared your ideas with anyone for the past 5 years?"

"I wanted to share my ideas when I had finally accomplished my goals, but it's harder than I thought. I'm still thinking of a way to implement my ideas."

"What is your idea?"

Kasa's last question was one I was dreading the most. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't remember much about the prison systems in my past life. As a result, this would be the weakest portion of my lie. 

"I, I believe that prisoners should have jobs while they are in prison."
