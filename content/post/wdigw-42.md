"What nonsense are you talking about."

Ailsa interjected me.

"Criminals are those who have broken the law, instead of punishing them you want to reward them? Is this the idea you've spent your whole life on? If you didn't swear on your life I would've thought you were making a fool of me."

Ailsa's expression scared me, but I had already committed to the lie. 

Furthermore, I felt the more I talked the more my lies were improving. There was a possibility of pulling this off completely. However, I realized I needed to act more like a child, so I tried to dumb down my speech and reasoning.

"The prisoner would still be punished by staying in prison. I thought if the prisoner worked a job in prison they would realize the joy of working and stop committing crimes."

"... Once people have been tainted by crime, they cannot return. That's why I prevent people like you from becoming criminals before it's too late."

"While some people may be too 'tainted' to be fixed, I think that the majority can 'untainted'. "

"Are you saying that from personal experience?"

"No, no it's not from personal experience. I just think that some of the crimes committed were very small and prisoners could be taught to avoid those crimes."

Upon hearing the word minor, Ailsa's eyes lit up.

"No transgressions against the Alvaine empire is 'minor'."

I quickly tried to correct my mistake.

"I didn't mean to say minor, I meant to say prisoners who committed less bad crimes. For example, if a pers"

"Hmph, while I don't agree with your thought process at all, I think there is a little bit of merit in what you're saying."

That easily? I'm surprised that she was convinced just like that. Perhaps my reasoning was persuasive. Or, perhaps she's less headstrong than I originally imagined. Either way, I welcomed the closure of this situation.

"Very well, what was the problem you encountered?"

"T"

"Then I will grant you those resources, prove to me in the next few weeks that your strategy works."

I wasn't expecting her to make me implement my idea. I honestly had no clue how to go about it, and it wouldn't be easy for me to come up with something on the fly. Do I try to renegotiate with her?

"Rorik Pendle, I hope you don't misunderstand my tolerance for mercy. I'm not convinced that was the only reason to visit the prison. The only reason I haven't continued  What I'm telling you is not a request, but an order."

I wondered what exactly 'swearing on your life' meant in this world. I'd seen it a few times in stories, but I essentially glossed over it. I should probably get someone to clarify that before I use the expression again.

My thoughts were interrupted by Ailsa.

"Let us depart back to the Pendle mansion."

As we walked back, to the carriage, Ailsa took the time to strike up one last conversation with me.

"I trust you won't let anyone else know what happened in the forest today. Otherwise, you will face the consequences."

I wasn't planning on telling anyone in the first place. I felt that it would cause me more trouble than it's worth. In the first place, I don't want to get involved with her. Although it might be a bit too late for that at this point. "My lips are sealed."

I had no conversations on the return trip to the Pendle Mansion. Ailsa no longer paid attention to me, and I was busy thinking about the future.

I believe my actions had mixed results.

On one hand, I was just happy I avoided getting hurt any further. I think that was the first time I got punched this hard in either lifetime. I put my hand on my stomach, and couldn't help but shudder as I remembered the pain and lack of breath I experienced. Worst of all, that was her holding back. If she unleashed a punch at full power, I don't think I would've been in one piece. This experience was a good reminder to learn Az even faster. 

On the other hand, objectively, it was probably a better idea to get beaten up by Ailsa. After all, she probably would've left after that, and I wouldn't have gotten involved with her any further.

With how it is now, the time I can spend on my preparations to run away has been reduced considerably. Furthermore, I'm certain that my upcoming interactions with Ailsa will cause rumors to spread. The rumors that I've been interacting with the princess will definitely be spread to Kasa faster than I originally anticipated.

Overall, I couldn't do anything about the rumors except hope that they didn't spread fast. Instead, I had to focus my attention on figuring out a way to get what Ailsa wants from me.
