I spend the rest of the night figuring out what to do. In hindsight, I really should've let Ailsa punch me. I have no clue how to approach giving prisoners a job. 'Well, hindsight is 20/20, let's just focus on what I can do now.' After brainstorming 

I came out with one main conclusion. I had to fail. If I somehow succeeded in achieving some sort of prison reform, without a doubt, Ailsa would bring me with her to the royal capital. I can only shudder when I imagine that scenario.

On the other hand, my failure had to be believable. If Ailsa thought I was working superficially, she would beat me up. I went this far for avoiding pain, so I'd like to see it through thoroughly.

Although I tried to make a plan, there was too much information I didn't know. In the end, the most I could come up with was a rough outline. The outline was simple, first, I find someone who is about to be released and commits constant petty crimes. Next, I give him a small monetary incentive to do some menial job in prison, and then another smaller monetary incentive to not commit crimes outside of prison. After that, I simply wait a few days for him to commit another petty crime and go to jail.

I believe the plan would work because it would satisfy both my goals, I would fail after my scapegoat inevitably commits another crime, and Ailsa would be - hopefully - be satisfied with the amount of work I put into this entire endeavor.

I wasn't worried about the criminal not committing crimes any longer because I was aiming to find someone who had a habit of committing crimes.

Unfortunately, by the time I came up with this, it was already morning. I wanted to sleep in but unfortunately, Ailsa was coming to meet me today.

As I was playing around with Tracking, I heard a knock on my door. I was surprised to see that it was the person in charge of my meals, except this time he had no food with him. As soon as I opened the door, he began speaking.

"The duke has requested your presence at the dining table. Allow me to guide you."

"Very well."

As I walked behind him, I wondered who would be present. Perhaps it would be the first time I've seen my mother in a few years or my younger brother at all. Strangely enough, I've had passing glimpses of my other siblings, but haven't seen one of my brothers. I wondered what his reaction would be when he sees me. Judging by how my mother reacted, it would probably be hatred. 


To my surprise, the only people at the table were Duke Pendle, Fynn, a young boy who I assumed was my direct younger brother and my younger half-sibling sister. I thought there would be a few more siblings, but I realized that my two older brothers are outside the house at the moment, and my older sister married when I was very young.

My siblings had similar reactions to my presence, mostly indifference with a varying amount of hatred. The young boy had the most amount of hatred towards me, while Fynn had the least. 

I began eating after greeting Duke Pendle. As I took the first bite, I could help but widen my eyes at the taste. It was better than anything I was ever served. As I continued to eat, I couldn't help but be a bit jealous of my younger siblings.

Despite calling me here, Duke Pendle didn't converse with me. The only thing he told me after I greeted him, was "You shall dine here from now on." I chose to ignore the incredulous looks on my siblings' faces and focused on eating as much food as I could while maintaining my manners.

The silence at the dining table was maintained until a butler whispered something into Duke Pendle's ear, to which he responded by nodding.

Minutes later, Ailsa came into the dining hall.

'He was probably aiming for this.' I thought to myself as I took another bite of the meal before me.

Ailsa greeted the Duke and began speaking to me.

"Rorik, are you prepared to begin."

"Yes I am." 

I excused myself from the meal and followed Ailsa back into her carriage.

Unlike the last time, Saven was in the carriage as well. When he saw me enter, his eyes lit up and he nodded at me.

The carriage began moving a little after Ailsa took her seat. Unlike yesterday, I could predict we were headed to the prison. 

While I was staring out the window, I heard tapping coming from the opposite end. I realized that it was time to know my fate for the next few weeks.

"Rorik"

"Yes?"

"Can I presume that you haven't forgotten the deal we made yesterday?"

"Yes, I remember it."

She flashed a smile.

"At least we know that you can remember things for one day now."

"..."

"I will give you a deadline of 3 months. If you are unable to produce results by then, we will resume where we left off."

I wasn't happy or sad hearing the deadline, 3 months was around what I was expecting. Although I felt it necessary to clarify something else.

"How will you quantify my results?"

"Pick someone who would be released in the next two months. The last month will determine whether or not your methods have merit."

I wanted to criticize some aspects of her little challenge, such as how limiting it was for me to pick someone who gets released in two months, and how the second half of her statement was effectively her saying 'I decide the outcome', but I held my tongue. It wasn't worth arguing with someone who had an attitude hers. I just had to get this over with.

"I assume you've already been acquainted with Saven. While I will accompany you for the first few days, Saven will be my eyes and ears for the next couple of months."

Saven and I nodded at each other. Ailsa stopped speaking and the carriage was in silence until we reached the jail.
