So, it's been a while. Obviously I haven't updated in a long time but I do in fact intend to finish this, and am regretful. As a result I've come up with a plan for getting back on track with updating.
First things first, Payment will be paused for the Feb + March cycle.
I've already paused payments a few times before since I haven't updated, but this time I'll be pausing for the two months so I can get back on track to updating. I'll also be making the current Patreon chapters available on discord so feel free to unsubscribe at this time if you wish. 


Here's the intended timeline for the next two months (8 weeks).


Week 1- I've misplaced my notes for my writing, so although I know the path the story should take, I don't remember the exact details and things revealed. I'll be taking one week to reread and write some notes on the current path of the story.


Weeks 2-4 - I'm not to sure of the quality of the chapters currently on the Patreon so after reading them (with the context of the past chapters), I'll decide whether to rewrite/edit them.


Weeks 3-5- I hope to settle in with at least 1 chapter a week during these weeks to establish a routine.


Weeks 5-8- Once a schedule is established, I intend to slowly reduce it from once a week to somewhere between 3-5 times a week.


I feel that I haven't done people who have subscribed previously right so I intend to also message any previous subscriber who didn't 
cancel their pledge after like a day chapters for these 8 weeks as well.


If there are any questions or concerns about the schedule please comment.


I'll try to keep a weekly update to the schedule somewhere.
